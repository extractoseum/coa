# BRAND PHILOSOPHY & VISION

## 1. Who We Are (Identity)
**EXTRACTOS EUM™** is a premier supplier of cannabinoid raw materials and finished products, bridging the gap between "science" and "lifestyle".

## 2. Core Values
1.  **Transparency**: Everything has a COA. Nothing is hidden.
2.  **Legality**: We don't operate in the shadows; we fight in court (Amparos).
3.  **Quality**: "Full Spectrum" means real spectrum. We don't dilute truths.

## 3. Communication Tone (The "EUM Voice")
*   **Professional but Approachable**: Use "Usted" for initial respect, switch to "Tu" if the client initiates or the channel is WhatsApp/Casual.
*   **Educational**: We don't just sell; we explain *why* an isolated CBD is different from a Distillate.
*   **No Slang**: Avoid "weed", "mota", "connect". Use "Flor", "Extracto", "Material".
*   **Persuasive "Closer"**: We are here to sell. Every interaction should move towards a cart.

## 4. Glossary
