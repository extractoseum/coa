# SWIS Product Demo Script (5 Minutes)

## Scene 1: The Problem (0:00 - 1:00)
**Visual**: A developer staring at a broken CI pipeline.
**Audio**: "Every week, it's the same story. A CSS class changes, a selector breaks, and your entire QA suite goes red. We call this 'Frontend Entropy'."
**Visual**: Montage of "Element Not Found" errors in Playwright/Cypress.
**Audio**: "Your tests are brittle. Your monitoring is passive. And worst of all, your application is invisible to the next generation of users: AI Agents."

## Scene 2: The Contract (1:00 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Split screen. Left: `uiMap.ts` code. Right: The App.
**Action**: Developer hovers over a button. The key `nav.user.dashboard` highlights.
**Audio**: "Enter SWIS. It starts with The Map. A single source of truth that defines the 'Semantic Contract' of your application."
**Action**: Developer changes a `data-testid` in the code but forgets the map.
**Visual**: Terminal turns RED instantly. `Drift Detected`.
**Audio**: "Code references are checked in real-time. No more Ghost Beacons."

## Scene 3: The Immune System (2:00 - 3:00)
**Visual**: GitHub PR page.
**Action**: A bot comments on a PR. "I found 3 unmapped elements. Here is a fix."
**Audio**: "SWIS includes a self-healing immune system. It detects new interactions and automatically proposes updates to the map. It fixes the drift before it merges."

## Scene 4: The Watchtower (3:00 - 4:00)
**Visual**: The new **Telemetry Dashboard** (Dark Mode, Neon Graphs).
**Action**: Simulated Error Spike. The "Health" card flips from Green to Red.
**Audio**: "In production, SWIS is your Watchtower. It captures not just logs, but 'Signals'. Error spikes, slow routes, anomalies—visualized instantly."
**Visual**: Zoom in on the "Insights Summary" card.

## Scene 5: Agent Ready (4:00 - 5:00)
**Visual**: Terminal running `npx playwright test Agent-Challenge`.
**Action**: Browser opens. An AI Agent navigates the site smoothly at super-speed.
**Audio**: "Finally, SWIS validates your app for the future. The 'Agent Challenge' proves your UI is trustworthy for AI traversal."
**Visual**: "Trust Score: 100%".
**Audio**: "SWIS. Resilience for the Agent Age."
